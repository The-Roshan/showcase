# Project Showcase Website

## Overview
This is a fully functional, attractive project showcase website built with **Node.js** (backend) and **React** (frontend). The website is designed to elegantly display a portfolio of projects, featuring a modern UI with responsive design, smooth animations, and an intuitive user experience. It includes a backend API for managing project data and a dynamic frontend for showcasing projects with rich visuals and interactivity.

## Features
- **Dynamic Project Display**: Showcase projects with images, descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations and transitions powered by React libraries (e.g., Framer Motion).
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express backend with RESTful endpoints for managing project data.
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB for storing project details (optional, can be adapted to other databases).
- **Authentication (Optional)**: User login for admin access to add/edit projects.
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags and structured data for better search engine visibility.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized bundle size and lazy-loaded images for quick load times.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional, configurable)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Heroku/Railway (backend)
- **Other Tools**: Vite (for fast React builds), Axios (for API calls)

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**: For package management
- **MongoDB**: If using a database (local or cloud like MongoDB Atlas)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Roshan/showcase.git
cd showcase
```

### 2. Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```
   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB Atlas URI or local MongoDB connection string.
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
   This points the frontend to the backend API.
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified by Vite).

### 4. Access the Application
- Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the website.
- Use the admin interface (if enabled) to add/edit projects via the backend API.

## Usage
- **Browse Projects**: Navigate to the homepage to view featured projects in a grid or carousel layout.
- **Filter/Search**: Use filters (e.g., by technology or category) to find specific projects.
- **Admin Panel (Optional)**: Log in to add, edit, or delete projects via a protected route.
- **Responsive Experience**: Test the site on various devices to ensure responsiveness.

## Deployment
- **Frontend**:
  1. Build the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm run build
     ```
  2. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify by uploading the `dist` folder or linking the repository.
- **Backend**:
  1. Deploy to Heroku/Railway by pushing the `backend` directory.
  2. Set environment variables (`PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`) in the hosting platform.
- Ensure the frontend's `VITE_API_URL` points to the deployed backend URL.
